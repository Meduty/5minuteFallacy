Analysis and Evaluation of a Discrete Round-Based MOBA Economy and Progression ModelExecutive SummaryThe modeling of Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) dynamics within a discrete, round-based framework requires a rigorous translation of continuous-time mechanics—such as gold accumulation, power spikes, and objective control—into quantized states. The proposed model, defined by a 50-round limit, linearly scaling event income, and a logistic power transfer function, presents a sophisticated closed-loop economic system. This report provides an exhaustive evaluation of this model, simulating its behavior, defining its governing mathematics, and critiquing its stability against established game design principles and industry data.The core tension in the proposed model lies between the linear accumulation of resources (the Event Phase) and the non-linear utility of those resources (the Logistic Power Phase). This interaction creates a dynamic where early-game advantages accelerate slowly due to the convex nature of the logistic tail, mid-game advantages compound rapidly as players traverse the linear inflection point, and late-game advantages stagnate as the saturation ceiling is reached. This trajectory mirrors the "power spike" pacing seen in titles like League of Legends and Dota 2, where item completion dictates tempo.Furthermore, the "Game-End Trigger" logic transforms the match duration from a deterministic outcome into a probabilistic variable governed by survival analysis. By modeling the game-end probability as a hazard function dependent on both time ($t$) and lead magnitude ($L$), the system effectively simulates the psychological and structural pressures that lead to "surrenders" or "base races" in competitive play. The analysis confirms that to achieve the desired "bell-shaped" derivative of game endings (a Normal or Weibull distribution of match lengths), the hazard function must scale geometrically with time while being exponentially sensitive to the gold lead.This report is structured to first deconstruct the mathematical architecture of the three game phases, then analyze the specific implications of the logistic parameters ($L=20000, x_0=8500$), and finally simulate the behavioral archetypes—Snowball, Stalemate, and Comeback—that emerge from these rules.1. Introduction: Theoretical Framework of Discrete MOBA EconomiesThe transition from continuous-time gameplay (as seen in Dota 2 or League of Legends) to a discrete, 50-round model represents a fundamental shift in how resources and power are conceptualized. In a continuous game, power is a function of gold per minute (GPM) and experience per minute (XPM), integrated over time. In the proposed discrete model, power is a state variable updated at specific intervals. This abstraction retains the strategic core of the genre—the feedback loop of accumulation—while isolating the economic variables for precise tuning.1.1 The Shift from Continuous to Discrete StatesIn traditional MOBAs, the economy is fluid. Passive gold trickles in every 0.6 seconds , and kills occur irregularly. The proposed model quantizes this into 50 rounds. This implies that each round represents a significant aggregation of time—likely equivalent to 0.5 to 1.0 minutes of real-time gameplay, assuming a standard MOBA match lasts 25-50 minutes.This quantization necessitates a robust handling of variance. In a 40-minute Dota 2 game, thousands of small interactions (last hits, trades) average out to determine the winner. In a 50-round model, there are only 50 "Event Phases" to decide the outcome. Consequently, the mathematical weight of each event is magnified. The model’s reliance on a weighted random draw for event resolution introduces a high degree of variance that must be carefully managed to prevent the game from feeling arbitrary.1.2 The Feedback Loop ArchitectureThe model is built on two competing feedback loops:Positive Feedback (The Snowball): Winning the Event Phase yields additional income ($I_{event}$). Higher income leads to higher Gold ($G$). Higher Gold leads to higher Fighting Power ($FP$) via the logistic map. Higher $FP$ increases the probability of winning the next Event. This loop drives the game toward a conclusion.Negative Feedback (Diminishing Returns): The logistic function $T(G)$ saturates at 20,000 gold. As a player approaches this cap, the marginal utility of each additional gold unit approaches zero. This dampens the snowball effect in the late game, allowing trailing players to "catch up" in relative power even if the absolute gold gap remains.The balance of the game—whether it feels like a "stomp" or a "nail-biter"—depends entirely on the tuning of the intersection between the linear growth of the Event Phase and the sigmoidal curvature of the Power Phase.1.3 Parameters and DefinitionsFor the purpose of rigorous mathematical evaluation, we define the following system state variables:$R \in \{1, \dots, 50\}$: The current round index.$G_i(R)$: The total accumulated gold of player $i$ at the start of round $R$.$S_i$: The inherent skill coefficient of player $i$ (assumed constant, representing mechanical ability or game sense).$FP_i(R)$: The effective Fighting Power of player $i$, derived from $S_i$ and $G_i(R)$.$I_{base}$: The static income awarded in Phase 1 (Income Phase).$I_{event}(R)$: The contested income pool in Phase 2 (Event Phase), defined as $e + s$.$P_{end}(R)$: The probability that the game terminates in Phase 3 of round $R$.2. Phase I & II: Income Dynamics and InflationThe economic engine of the model is split into two distinct flows: the deterministic supply ($I_{base}$) and the contested supply ($I_{event}$). This separation is critical for maintaining competitive stability. If all income were contested, a single early loss could render a player destitute, breaking the game's agency. If all income were static, the game would lack conflict.2.1 The Stabilizing Role of Basic Income ($I_{base}$)In the Income Phase, both players receive $I_{base}$. Mathematically, this acts as a dilution of advantage. Consider a scenario where Player A has 1000 gold and Player B has 500 gold (a 2:1 ratio). If $I_{base} = 500$:$G_A' = 1500$$G_B' = 1000$The ratio shifts to 1.5:1. The relative advantage of the leader has decreased, even though the absolute difference remains the same.Insight from Research: This mirrors the "passive gold" mechanic in Dota 2 (approx. 90-100 gold/min). It ensures that supports or losing players can still purchase essential items (wards, boots) and participate in the game. In the user's model, $I_{base}$ prevents the "death spiral" where a losing player effectively stops playing due to lack of resources.2.2 The Destabilizing Role of Event Income ($I_{event}$)In the Event Phase, players fight over $I_{event} = e + s$. The user specifies that this amount linearly scales with rounds.$$I_{event}(R) = \alpha R + \beta$$where $\alpha$ is the scaling factor and $\beta$ is the base event value.Linear Scaling Analysis: Linear scaling implies that the economic weight of the game shifts toward the later rounds. A win in Round 40 is worth significantly more than a win in Round 5. This is consistent with MOBA design, where "creep waves" and "kill bounties" increase in value over time to match the increasing cost of high-tier items.The Components ($e$ and $s$): The prompt distinguishes between $e$ and $s$. In typical game theory terms:$e$ (Engagement Gold): The reward for winning the objective itself (e.g., taking a tower, killing Roshan/Baron).$s$ (Streak/Scaling Gold): A variable component that might depend on the state of the game. The user notes "scales linearly (e, s)", implying both components might scale.Mathematical Implication: If the Event Income scales linearly, say $I_{event}(R) = 20R$, the total gold available in the game grows quadratically (integral of linear function).$$G_{total}(R) \approx \sum_{i=1}^{R} (I_{base} + I_{event}(i)) \approx I_{base}R + \frac{\alpha}{2}R^2$$This quadratic growth of total gold is crucial. It ensures that players can reach the saturation point ($20,000$ gold) within the 50-round limit. If income were constant, reaching 20,000 might be mathematically impossible, rendering the logistic cap irrelevant.2.3 Inflation and Purchasing PowerThe interaction between $I_{base}$ (constant) and $I_{event}$ (scaling) creates an inflationary environment.In Round 1, if $I_{base}=100$ and $I_{event}=50$, the static income is dominant ($66\%$ of total).In Round 50, if $I_{base}=100$ and $I_{event}=1000$ (assuming scaling), the contested income is dominant ($91\%$ of total).Strategic Consequence: The game shifts from a "farming simulator" (Phase 1 dominant) to a "team-fight simulator" (Phase 2 dominant). Early game strategies might focus on efficiency (maximizing the utility of $I_{base}$), while late-game strategies must focus on combat (securing $I_{event}$). This satisfies the user's implicit desire for pacing that mirrors standard MOBA flow.3. Phase III: The Logistic Power TransformationThe defining mathematical feature of the user's model is the transformation of accumulated gold into Fighting Power ($FP$) via a logistic map. This function $T(G)$ dictates the relationship between economic success and combat advantage.3.1 Defining the Logistic FunctionThe user provides specific constraints for the logistic function:Saturation ($L$): 20,000 gold.Midpoint ($x_0$): 8,500 gold.Behavior: "Not too steep," with "approximate linear early growth."The general form of the logistic function is:$$T(G) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(G - x_0)}}$$Where:$L$ is the carrying capacity (maximum multiplier).$x_0$ is the inflection point.$k$ is the steepness (growth rate).However, there is a mathematical contradiction in the user's request. A standard logistic function is convex (curved upwards) for $G < x_0$. It starts flat and accelerates. It is not linear at the start; it is exponential. Linearity in a logistic curve only exists continuously at the inflection point ($x_0$). To achieve "approximate linear early growth," we must tune the parameter $k$ such that the curvature of the "tail" is minimized over the relevant domain $$.3.2 Tuning the Steepness ($k$)We need to find a value of $k$ such that the function does not suppress early game agency (by being too flat) nor decide the game immediately (by being too steep).Let's assume the power multiplier $T(G)$ is normalized such that $T(20000) \approx 1.0$ (representing 100% build efficiency).$$T(G) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(G - 8500)}}$$To find $k$, we can set a target "base power" for $G=0$. In MOBAs, a hero with 0 gold (naked) still has base stats. Let's assume $T(0) = 0.1$ (10% effectiveness).$$0.1 = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(0 - 8500)}} \implies 1 + e^{8500k} = 10 \implies e^{8500k} = 9 \\ 8500k = \ln(9) \approx 2.197 \\ k \approx \frac{2.197}{8500} \approx 0.000258$$Let's test this $k$ value at the midpoint ($G=8500$). The slope (marginal gain) at the midpoint is $k \cdot L / 4$.$$\text{Slope}_{max} = \frac{0.000258}{4} = 0.0000645 \text{ power per gold}$$This creates a very shallow curve.Alternative Tuning: The user wants "linear early growth." This suggests the curve should essentially look like a straight line from 0 to 8500, then taper off. To achieve this behavior mathematically, we might need to "zoom in" on the logistic curve, effectively using the inflection point as the start or pushing the inflection point lower.However, sticking to the user's constraints ($x_0 = 8500$), the behavior will inherently be:0 to 4000 Gold: Slow, accelerating growth (Early Game).4000 to 13000 Gold: Fast, quasi-linear growth (Mid Game Power Spike).13000 to 20000 Gold: Decelerating growth (Diminishing Returns).Recommended $k$: To make the early game feel responsive (quasi-linear), we should accept a slightly higher starting value or a steeper slope. A value of $k \approx 0.0004$ provides a strong balance.$T(0) \approx 0.03$ (3% power).$T(4000) \approx 0.14$ (14% power).$T(8500) = 0.50$ (50% power).$T(13000) \approx 0.86$ (86% power).$T(20000) \approx 0.99$ (99% power).3.3 The Implication of Saturation (The 20,000 Cap)The hard saturation at 20,000 gold is the most critical control mechanism in the model. It introduces Diminishing Returns to Scale.
In standard economics, diminishing returns stabilize competition. If Player A has 19,000 gold and Player B has 15,000 gold, the gold lead is 4,000.$T(19000) \approx 0.985$$T(15000) \approx 0.924$Difference in Power: $\approx 6.1\%$.Compare this to an early game scenario with the same 4,000 gold lead:Player A: 6,000 gold ($T \approx 0.26$)Player B: 2,000 gold ($T \approx 0.07$)Difference in Power: $\approx 19\%$.Strategic Insight: This dynamic (Power Delta shrinking as Gold grows) means that early leads are lethal, but late leads are recoverable. The model naturally creates a "rubber band" effect in the late game without requiring artificial catch-up mechanics. If the trailing player can survive to the saturation phase, the power gap will naturally close, turning the game into a skill-based (50/50) contest rather than a gold-based one.4. Phase III (Part B): The Game-End Trigger and Survival AnalysisThe user's most complex requirement is the Game-End Trigger. This is not a simple score limit but a probabilistic termination condition.Inputs: Round Number ($R$), Relative Lead ($L_{rel}$).Constraints: Lead is significant. Derivative is bell-shaped. Guaranteed end at 50. 10-20% survival rate to 50.4.1 Defining the Hazard FunctionThe probability that the game ends in round $R$, given it hasn't ended yet, is the hazard function $\lambda(R)$.
The unconditional probability that the game ends exactly at round $R$ is the Probability Density Function (PDF), $f(R)$.
The user specifies that the "derivative is bell shaped." Since the trigger probability itself is a cumulative concept in the user's description ("chance increases with progression"), they likely mean the distribution of game durations should be bell-shaped.
To achieve a bell-shaped PDF (like a Normal or Weibull distribution) for game duration, the hazard function $\lambda(R)$ must effectively be a power function of time.4.2 Mathematical Derivation of the Bell CurveWe utilize the Weibull Distribution model, commonly used for failure analysis and session times.
The hazard function for a Weibull distribution is:
$$h(t) = \frac{\kappa}{\lambda} \left( \frac{t}{\lambda} \right)^{\kappa - 1}$$Where $\kappa$ is the shape parameter and $\lambda$ is the scale parameter.If $\kappa < 1$: Hazard decreases (not applicable).If $\kappa = 1$: Constant hazard (Exponential distribution).If $\kappa > 1$: Hazard increases with time.If $\kappa \approx 3.5$: The resulting PDF approximates a Normal (Bell) Distribution.Therefore, the "progression" component of the trigger chance must scale with $R^{2.5}$ or roughly $R^3$.$$P_{time}(R) = C \cdot R^3$$4.3 Integrating the Relative Lead ($L_{rel}$)The user states "Lead is more significant than progression."This implies the hazard function is a superposition of a Time Component and a Lead Component.$$h(R, L_{rel}) = h_{time}(R) + h_{lead}(L_{rel})$$Let's normalize the lead $L_{rel} = \frac{|G_A - G_B|}{G_{max}}$.The lead component should likely be sigmoidal: low leads have no effect, high leads drastically increase surrender/end probability.$$h_{lead}(L_{rel}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-m(L_{rel} - \theta)}}$$Where $\theta$ is the "surrender threshold" (e.g., a 25% gold lead).4.4 Tuning for the 20% Survival RateThe user requires that $10-20\%$ of games reach Round 50.Let $S(t)$ be the Survival Function (probability game is NOT over by time $t$).$$S(t) = \exp\left( - \int_{0}^{t} h(u) du \right)$$We need $S(50) \approx 0.15$.$$-\int_{0}^{50} h(u) du = \ln(0.15) \approx -1.9$$$$\int_{0}^{50} h(u) du \approx 1.9$$If we ignore the lead for a moment (assuming a balanced game) and use the Weibull hazard $h(t) = a t^3$:$$\int_{0}^{50} a t^3 dt = a \left[ \frac{t^4}{4} \right]_0^{50} = a \frac{6,250,000}{4} = 1,562,500 a$$$$1,562,500 a = 1.9 \implies a \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-6}$$Resulting Formula:The base probability of the game ending in round $R$ (due to time pressure) should be:$$P_{time}(R) \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-6} \times R^3$$At Round 10: $P \approx 0.001$ (0.1%).At Round 30: $P \approx 0.03$ (3%).At Round 45: $P \approx 0.11$ (11%).At Round 50: Forced Trigger.This creates the desired "low early, peak mid-late" behavior. The addition of the Lead component will naturally truncate this distribution, shifting the peak earlier (left-skew) for unbalanced games, which matches real-world data where "stomps" end faster than even matches.5. Phase II (Part B): The Combat Resolution MathThe Event Phase winner is decided by a weighted random draw:$$P(A_{win}) = \frac{FP_A}{FP_A + FP_B}$$5.1 The Bradley-Terry ModelThis formula is the standard Bradley-Terry model for paired comparisons. It has significant implications for variance.Scenario: Player A has $FP=100$, Player B has $FP=100$.$P(A) = 0.5$. Variance is maximized ($\sigma^2 = 0.25$).Scenario: Player A has $FP=200$ (double), Player B has $FP=100$.$P(A) = 0.66$.Critique: Even with double the fighting power, Player A still loses 1 out of 3 times. In a 50-round game, this means the "better" player will lose approximately 16 rounds purely due to RNG, even with a massive advantage.5.2 Variance vs. AgencyThis high variance acts as a soft rubber-band. It prevents the "Snowball" from being deterministic. Even if Player A gets a lead, they cannot guarantee the next Event income; they only secure a statistical edge.However, this can lead to frustration. A player might optimize their economy perfectly to get a $2x$ lead, only to lose the critical Round 49 event due to a $33\%$ chance roll.Design Note: Many games mitigate this by using a steeper curve, such as a "Power Law" probability:$$P(A) = \frac{FP_A^2}{FP_A^2 + FP_B^2}$$Using the square of FP would turn a 2:1 lead into an $80\%$ win chance, rewarding the lead more consistently while keeping some uncertainty. Given the user's prompt does not specify the exponent, the linear ($FP^1$) version implies a high-variance, "chaotic" battlefield.6. Simulation of Behavioral ArchetypesWe now apply these formulas to simulate the three most common game states.6.1 Simulation A: The "Snowball" (Stomp)Conditions: Player A gets a lucky streak in Rounds 1-5 ($I_{event}$ secured).Rounds 1-10:Player A accumulates gold faster. Because the logistic curve is convex initially ($k=0.0004$), the power gain is slow ($T(G)$ rises from 0.03 to 0.10).Player B is only slightly behind in power.Result: The game remains competitive early. The "stomp" doesn't start instantly.Rounds 15-25 (The Breakpoint):Player A crosses the Linear Inflection Point ($G > 5000$). Their power gain per gold accelerates to its maximum.Player B is still stuck in the slow early curve.Divergence: $FP_A$ shoots up to $0.5 \times Skill$, while $FP_B$ lags at $0.2 \times Skill$.$P(A_{win})$ approaches $70-80\%$. A wins most events.The Lead ($L$): The gold gap widens rapidly. The Lead Component of the Game-End Trigger activates.$$h_{lead}(L) \to \text{High}$$Outcome: The game terminates via the Trigger around Round 25-30. The duration is short, consistent with real-world data on "stomps".6.2 Simulation B: The "Stalemate" (Saturation)Conditions: Players trade event wins 50/50 through the mid-game.Rounds 1-35:Both players progress evenly.Both players cross the 8,500 midpoint.Rounds 35-45 (The Ceiling):Both players reach 15,000+ gold.The logistic curve flattens ($T(G) > 0.9$).Marginal Utility Collapse: Player A wins an event, goes to 17,000 gold. $T$ moves from 0.95 to 0.97. This power increase is negligible.Combat remains a 50/50 coin flip.The Lead ($L$): The relative lead is near zero.The Trigger: The "Lead" component of the hazard function is 0. The game relies entirely on the "Time" component ($R^3$).Outcome: The game drags on until the Time Hazard becomes overwhelming or the Round 50 hard cap is hit. This scenario effectively tests the patience of the players, as economic decisions cease to matter after Round 40.6.3 Simulation C: The "Comeback" (Logistic Rubber-Banding)Conditions: Player A leads early, but B wins a high-value Event in Round 40.State at Round 40:Player A: 20,000 Gold (Capped). $T(A) \approx 0.99$.Player B: 12,000 Gold. $T(B) \approx 0.80$.Power Disadvantage: B has 20% less power.The Event: B gets lucky (wins the 40% roll) and secures a massive late-game bounty ($I_{event} = \text{High}$).Impact:Player A gets gold, but $T(A)$ cannot go higher than 1.0. Zero Power Gain.Player B gets gold, pushing them from 12k to 14k. $T(B)$ jumps from 0.80 to 0.90.Gap Closure: The power gap halves in a single round.Outcome: The "Saturation Cap" punishes the leader for having nothing left to buy. The linear scaling of late-game income rewards the loser disproportionately (in terms of utility). This allows B to stabilize and potentially win a 50/50 endgame roll.7. Comparative Analysis & Evaluation7.1 Comparison with Industry StandardsThe proposed model aligns surprisingly well with established MOBA mechanics, despite its abstraction.Gold Curve: The logistic saturation mirrors the "Six Slot" inventory limit in Dota 2. Once a carry is full-slotted, their net worth advantage becomes irrelevant.Comeback Logic: League of Legends uses Objective Bounties to artificially inject gold into the losing team. The proposed model achieves this organically via the logistic derivative. The "value" of gold is higher for the poorer player. This is a more elegant mathematical solution than arbitrary bounty lookup tables.Surrender Math: Real players "calculate" surrender probability based on win % and time remaining. The proposed Hazard Function ($h \propto R^3 + \text{Lead}$) effectively automates this psychological process.7.2 Critique and RecommendationsStrength: The model is self-regulating. The logistic curve prevents infinite runaway snowballs, and the probability trigger prevents infinite stalls.Weakness: The weighted random draw ($FP / \sum FP$) is too "noisy" for a competitive game. It diminishes the feeling of skill agency.Weakness: The midpoint of 8,500 might be too high if income is low, keeping players in the "boring" low-power phase for too long.Key Tuning Recommendations:Steepness ($k$): Fix $k \approx 0.0004$ to ensure the mid-game (4k-13k gold) feels impactful.Trigger Sensitivity: Ensure the "Lead" weight in the hazard function is high enough ($\beta \gg \alpha$) so that a 50% gold lead at Round 20 ends the game immediately. It is boring to play out a 30-round stomp.Income Scaling: Calibrate $\alpha$ in $I_{event} = \alpha R + \beta$ such that the Total Gold at Round 50 is roughly $2.5 \times (20,000)$. This ensures that even in a split game, both players can reach saturation, forcing a "clash of titans" ending.8. ConclusionThe proposed 50-round MOBA model is a viable economic simulation that successfully captures the genre's core macro-dynamics. By coupling linear accumulation with logistic utilization, it creates a phase-based flow: an early game of slow ramp-up, a mid-game of explosive power spikes, and a late-game of high-stakes efficiency. The Probabilistic Game-End Trigger is a standout feature, mathematically ensuring that match durations follow a natural, bell-shaped distribution that respects the dominance of a clear leader while preventing endless stalemates. With the specific tuning of the logistic steepness ($k$) and the hazard function's power law ($R^3$), this model can simulate the emotional arc of a MOBA match—from the optimism of the laning phase to the tension of the late-game siege—purely through discrete math.Detailed Mathematical Appendix: Defining the Core Equations1.
